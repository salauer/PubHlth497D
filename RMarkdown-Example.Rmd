## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. To create an R Markdown sheet of your own, click `File->New File->R Markdown`. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. To see the cheatsheets for R Markdown click `Help->Cheatsheets->R Markdown Cheat Sheet` or `R Markdown Reference Guide`.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk by clicking the **Insert** button and creating a chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Installing and loading libraries

There are many built-in functions in R, such as `mean()`, `max()`, and `min()`:

```{r built-in}
small_numbers <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
mean(small_numbers)
max(small_numbers)
min(small_numbers)
```

But sometimes you want to run a function that does not start in R. Some of these functions are in "Packages" that you do not have in your "Library." For instance, we will use `ggplot2` to visualize our data later in this course. The `qplot()` function makes a quick plot based on a variable for x and y. To try and run this, set `eval=TRUE` in the chunk below:

```{r qplot without library, eval=FALSE}
squared_smalls <- small_numbers^2
qplot(x=small_numbers, y=squared_smalls)
```

When `eval=TRUE`, R Markdown throws an error. R does not know what `qplot()` is! In order to use `qplot()`, you must first install and load the library `ggplot2`. To run this, set `eval=TRUE` below (don't forget to set `eval=FALSE` for the last chunk):

```{r qplot with library, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x=small_numbers, y=squared_smalls)
```

You only need to install a package once on your machine, from then on you can just use `library()` to load it in the future.

Here are two more ways to install packages in RStudio:

1. Click `Tools->Install Packages...`
2. Click on "Packages" in the lower-right section of the RStudio (where it says "Files", "Plots", "Packages", "Help", "Viewer"). Then click "Install."

If you don't know which package you need for your particular problem, there is a huge online community at your disposal.
You can simply Google your question, starting with "r": i.e. "r how to draw a random number" (don't use the quotes).
Often **stackoverflow.com** has the solution you are looking for; this is a community where users post questions and other users provide answers.
Sometimes the answers require you to install a new package, now you are able to do so!

Packages are very useful in R and one day you might even write one yourself!

## Using Help

Another useful function in R is the `?` function.
When you aren't sure what arguments are needed for a function, use the `?` to find out!

For instance, missing data can be a real pain.
Missing data is demarked as `NA`, and can ruin your basic functions.

```{r missing data problems}
vector_with_na <- c(1,2,NA,4,5)
mean(vector_with_na)
```

The mean of a vector with an `NA` is always `NA`, which doesn't help you very much.
Perhaps you want to take the mean of the vector without the missing component.
As you may have learned, you can re-write your vector within the function as:

```{r re-written vector}
mean(vector_with_na[-3])
```

This takes out the one missing data and takes the average of the rest.
But what if you don't know where all the missing data are or there are many of these missing data, which makes writing this out very awkward?
You can use `?mean` to view the Help file and find that the `na.rm` option will take out all of the `NA` values before taking the mean!

```{r re-written function}
mean(vector_with_na, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The Help function is available for all base R functions (the built-in ones) and for many of the packages you download from CRAN (a large package database).

Between Help and stackoverflow.com, you can find the answers to many of your programming questions!
